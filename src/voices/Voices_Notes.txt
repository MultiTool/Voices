What next?

Any iplayable's playerhead should treat that playable as if its time begins at 0, and ends at Duration.  So rename getfinaltime to Duration_G() or Get_Duration. 

Should any playable know absolute time?  we can leave that for later.

Are we going to support time scaling/compressing?  Only for rythm, therefore not for pitch.  
So in the future every playerhead can ref an absoluterealtime clock, but we will cross that bridge when we get to it.  
Or rather we might have a Tempo coordinate, but not yet.  It can be derived from absoluterealtime.  

EndTime -= this.RealTimeAbsolute;// ???   // first, have to convert EndTime to local time offset. 
// EndTime -= this.TimeLoc;//.RealTimeAbsolute;// ???   // first, have to convert EndTime to local time offset.
